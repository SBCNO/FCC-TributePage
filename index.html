            Eddie Gay Robinson was born Feb. 13, 1919, in Jackson, La., the only child of a sometime sharecropper and a domestic servant. He played quarterback at Leland College in Baker, La., where he earned a bachelor’s degree and then worked in a feed mill for 25 cents an hour.

His sister knew the wife of Dr. Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones, the president of Grambling, a state college known at the time as the Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute. Dr. Jones, who was also Grambling’s longtime baseball coach, hired the quiet, serious Robinson, then a newlywed. In Robinson’s second season, he produced an undefeated football team. Eddie Robinson, who in 55 seasons as the football coach at Grambling State University won a record number of games, mentored scores of future professional players and helped bring racial awareness to a segregated Southern society.
            In becoming the first football coach in National Collegiate Athletic Association history to win 400 games, Robinson helped build Grambling from a small all-black college to an important predominantly black university with 5,000 students. He made Grambling famous while coaching teams to a 408-165-15 record. (In 2003, his victory total was surpassed by John Gagliardi of St. John’s University, a Division III institution in Collegeville, Minn. Robinson’s victory total is second only to Gagliardi’s 443.)

More than 200 of Robinson’s players went on to play in the National Football League. He was at Grambling from 1941 to 1997, although the university had no football teams in 1943 and ’44 because of World War II.Grambling’s success slipped in Robinson’s final coaching years, and some university officials and alumni wanted him replaced. He retired after the 1997 season, not because of his team’s performance, he said, but because it was time.

His devotion to his job was legendary. During a brief hospitalization for fatigue in October 1997, Robinson had a videocassette recorder and game tapes brought to his hospital bed so he could prepare for the next game.
